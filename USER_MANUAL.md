# TalentFlow AI - User Manual

Welcome to TalentFlow AI, your intelligent, autonomous recruitment partner. This guide will walk you through the core features of the platform.

## 1. The Main Interface: Your Command Center

The primary interface is organized into several tabs, each serving a specific purpose in the recruitment lifecycle.

### a. Prospecting Hub (The Heart of Matching)

This is the most important tab for managing and matching your unassigned talent. For the best results, start here.

-   **Overview:** This tab shows a table of **all unassigned candidates** who have passed the initial screening.
-   **Run AI Match for All (Key Action):** Click the **"Run AI Match for All"** button at the top. This is the system's core intelligent action. The AI will analyze every unassigned candidate in the background and compare them against all available client roles. This powerful process populates the entire system with the best role matches for each person and powers the features in the "Client Roles" tab.
-   **Assigning Roles:** Once the analysis is complete, the "Best Role Match" column will populate. You can assign a candidate to their best-fit role with a single click.

### b. Client Roles Tab

This is where you manage the job positions you are hiring for. The matching features here are powered by the analysis run in the Prospecting Hub.

-   **Adding a New Role:** Click the **"Add New Role"** button. You can paste an existing job description, and the AI will automatically format it professionally and suggest several appropriate job titles.
-   **Finding Candidates for a Role:** Each role card has powerful AI actions that leverage a smart cache created by the "Run AI Match for All" process:
    -   **Find Top Matches (AI):** This is the fastest and most intelligent feature. It instantly returns a curated list of the absolute best fits for that specific role from the pre-analyzed cache.
    -   **Find All Qualified:** This shows you every unassigned candidate who meets the baseline qualification (a score of 70+) for the role from the cache.
    -   **Re-engage Archives:** The AI will scan your archived/rejected candidates to see if any are a good fit for this new role, allowing you to resurrect past talent.
    -   **View Assigned Candidates:** This filters the "Candidate Pool" to show you only the candidates currently assigned to this role.

### c. Candidate Pool Tab

This is your visual pipeline, presented as a Kanban board.

-   **Adding Candidates:** Click **"Add Candidates"** to bulk upload resumes. The AI will screen them in the background, assign an initial score, and place them in the appropriate column.
-   **Kanban Workflow:**
    -   **Sourcing:** New candidates who didn't meet the initial quality bar are placed here and archived. You can review and restore them if needed.
    -   **Screening:** Qualified candidates land here after AI screening. They are now "Unassigned" and ready to be matched with a role in the "Prospecting Hub".
    -   **Interview:** Candidates who have been assigned a role and are undergoing the AI Gauntlet or other interview processes are moved here.
    -   **Hired:** The final stage for successful candidates.
-   **Moving Candidates:** Simply drag and drop a candidate's card from one column to the next to update their status.
-   **Stimulate Pipeline:** A powerful AI simulation that identifies a top candidate, creates a suitable role, runs them through a simulated interview, and hires them, demonstrating the platform's autonomous capabilities.

### d. Gauntlet Portal Tab

This tab is for managing candidates who have been shortlisted for the AI-proctored technical interview.

-   **Who appears here?** Any candidate with an initial AI score of 70 or higher who is not archived.
-   **Action:** Click **"Copy Credentials"** for a candidate. This copies their unique login URL, their Candidate ID, and the universal password (`TEST1234`) to your clipboard. Send these details to the candidate so they can begin their assessment.

### e. Analytics Tab

This dashboard provides insights into your recruitment pipeline, showing hiring velocity, role distribution, and predictive forecasts generated by the AI.

### f. Feedback Notes Tab

A dedicated portal for you and your team to leave feedback, report bugs, and ask questions about the platform.
- **Access:** Requires a separate login.
- **Features:** Supports threaded replies, allowing for collaborative discussions on each topic.

## 2. The Admin Command Center

The Admin portal provides the ultimate oversight and control over the entire system.

-   **Access:** Navigate to `/admin/login` and use the credentials:
    -   **Username:** `admin`
    -   **Password:** `admin1234`
-   **Features:**
    -   **Gauntlet Monitor:** Track the real-time progress of all candidates in the AI Gauntlet. See who has passed, who has failed, and who is in progress.
    -   **Master Candidate Database:** View and manage **every single candidate** in the system, including those who have been archived. This is the only place where you have the authority to **permanently delete** a candidate's record.
    -   **Proactive Sourcing Alerts:** The AI can autonomously scan for high-potential matches and create alerts here. You can directly assign the candidate to the suggested role with one click.
    -   **Send Final Communications:** A powerful one-click command to have the AI autonomously send offer emails to candidates who passed the Gauntlet and rejection notices to those who did not.

This manual provides a starting point for leveraging the power of TalentFlow AI. Explore the system and let the AI be your partner in building the future of talent acquisition.
