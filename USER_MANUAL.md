# TalentFlow AI - User Manual

Welcome to TalentFlow AI, your intelligent, autonomous recruitment partner. This guide will walk you through the core features of the platform.

## 1. The Main Interface: Your Command Center

The primary interface is organized into several tabs, each serving a specific purpose in the recruitment lifecycle.

### a. Client Roles Tab

This is where you manage the job positions you are hiring for.

-   **Adding a New Role:** Click the **"Add New Role"** button. You can paste an existing job description, and the AI will automatically format it professionally and suggest several appropriate job titles.
-   **Finding Candidates for a Role:** Each role card has powerful AI actions:
    -   **Find Top Matches (AI):** This is the most intelligent feature. It scans all unassigned candidates and returns a curated list of the absolute best fits for that specific role, based on a deep analysis of their skills and experience. It's fast because it uses a smart cache.
    -   **Find All Qualified:** This shows you every unassigned candidate who meets the baseline qualification (a score of 70+) for the role.
    -   **Re-engage Archives:** The AI will scan your archived/rejected candidates to see if any are a good fit for this new role, allowing you to resurrect past talent.
    -   **View Assigned Candidates:** This filters the "Candidate Pool" to show you only the candidates currently assigned to this role.

### b. Candidate Pool Tab

This is your visual pipeline, presented as a Kanban board.

-   **Adding Candidates:** Click **"Add Candidates"** to bulk upload resumes. The AI will screen them in the background, assign an initial score, and place them in the appropriate column.
-   **Kanban Workflow:**
    -   **Sourcing:** New candidates who didn't meet the initial quality bar are placed here and archived. You can review and restore them if needed.
    -   **Screening:** Qualified candidates land here after AI screening. They are now "Unassigned" and ready to be matched with a role in the "Prospecting Hub".
    -   **Interview:** Candidates who have been assigned a role and are undergoing the AI Gauntlet or other interview processes are moved here.
    -   **Hired:** The final stage for successful candidates.
-   **Moving Candidates:** Simply drag and drop a candidate's card from one column to the next to update their status.
-   **Stimulate Pipeline:** A powerful AI simulation that identifies a top candidate, creates a suitable role, runs them through a simulated interview, and hires them, demonstrating the platform's autonomous capabilities.

### c. Prospecting Hub

This is the most important tab for managing your unassigned talent.

-   **Overview:** This tab shows a table of **all unassigned candidates** who have passed the initial screening.
-   **Finding Matches:**
    -   **For a single candidate:** Click the "Find Matches" button on any row. The AI will instantly score that candidate against all available client roles.
    -   **For ALL candidates:** Click the **"Run AI Match for All"** button at the top. This is a powerful one-click command that analyzes every unassigned candidate in the background, populating the entire table with the best role matches for each person.
-   **Assigning Roles:** Once matches are found, you can assign a candidate to their best-fit role with a single click.

### d. Gauntlet Portal Tab

This tab is for managing candidates who have been shortlisted for the AI-proctored technical interview.

-   **Who appears here?** Any candidate with an initial AI score of 70 or higher who is not archived.
-   **Action:** Click **"Copy Credentials"** for a candidate. This copies their unique login URL, their Candidate ID, and the universal password (`TEST1234`) to your clipboard. Send these details to the candidate so they can begin their assessment.

### e. Analytics Tab

This dashboard provides insights into your recruitment pipeline, showing hiring velocity, role distribution, and predictive forecasts generated by the AI.

## 2. The Admin Command Center

The Admin portal provides the ultimate oversight and control over the entire system.

-   **Access:** Navigate to `/admin/login` and use the credentials:
    -   **Username:** `admin`
    -   **Password:** `admin1234`
-   **Features:**
    -   **Gauntlet Monitor:** Track the real-time progress of all candidates in the AI Gauntlet. See who has passed, who has failed, and who is in progress.
    -   **Master Candidate Database:** View and manage **every single candidate** in the system, including those who have been archived. This is the only place where you have the authority to **permanently delete** a candidate's record.
    -   **Proactive Sourcing Alerts:** The AI autonomously scans for high-potential matches and creates alerts here. You can directly assign the candidate to the suggested role with one click.
    -   **Send Final Communications:** A powerful one-click command to have the AI autonomously send offer emails to candidates who passed the Gauntlet and rejection notices to those who did not.

This manual provides a starting point for leveraging the power of TalentFlow AI. Explore the system and let the AI be your partner in building the future of talent acquisition.
