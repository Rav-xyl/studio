# **App Name**: TalentFlow AI

## Core Features:

- AI Role Suggestion: Analyzes candidate profiles (name, skills, narrative, inferred skills) to produce 2-3 succinct potential career opportunities along with rationale. AI uses its tool capabilities to incorporate candidate skill information and company requirements when forming the recommendations.
- Automated Resume Screening: Scans and analyzes all uploaded resumes, extracting skills, experiences, and other key information. The LLM uses reasoning to decide when to incorporate skill mappings and company preferences in determining candidate scoring.
- AI-Assisted Candidate Review: Leverages AI to review candidate data in 'Needs Manual Review' status. It uses its tool capabilities to determine the recommendation, plus a justification.
- Kanban Board: Provides a visual representation of candidates' progression through different stages: 'Uploaded', 'Processing', etc.
- Bulk Resume Upload: Allows uploading of multiple resumes at once.
- Full Pipeline Stimulation: Automated simulation across stages (screening, review, and role assignment), delivering data for future performance assessment. SAARTHI creates simulation results.
- Analytics Dashboard: Comprehensive performance review with roles assigned and key recruitment operations like resume upload numbers displayed via illustrative components.
- AI Video Interview: Conducts a video-based interview with the candidate, utilizing AI (ARYA and SAARTHI) to evaluate their responses and provide feedback. Includes an option to invite candidates via email based on AI shortlisting. Provides options to train the AI on interview data.
- Automated Job Description Synthesis: Instead of recruiters manually writing job descriptions or using a simple AI suggestion, the system autonomously synthesizes a detailed job description by analyzing a company's public information (website, career pages, social media) and its existing roles within Project Astra. It identifies the company's language, desired skill sets, and cultural values to generate a unique, highly-tailored JD. Recruiters simply provide a job title, and the AI does the rest. The LLM acts as a creative writer and market analyst, using its web browsing tool capabilities (simulated in this environment) to ingest company information and synthesize a new, context-rich JD. It uses reasoning to align the language and requirements with the company's brand identity.
- Continuous AI Rubric Refinement: This is a true 'AI training' feature. The system uses a feedback loop based on past hiring outcomes. After a candidate is successfully hired (marked in the Kanban board), the AI performs a self-evaluation. It compares the candidate's initial scores, the recruiter's deep review analysis, and the final 'Hire' decision. Over time, the LLM refines the weightings of the 12-point rubric and adjusts its own reasoning patterns to better identify successful candidates for a given company type. The recruiter can review the AI's suggested rubric changes for a given company. The LLM acts as a self-improving machine learning model. It analyzes structured and unstructured data from the hiring process to identify correlations between initial candidate attributes and final outcomes. This is a form of reinforcement learning, where the 'correct' outcome is a successful hire.
- AI-Driven Candidate Engagement: Once a candidate is in a stage like Eligible for Role, the AI drafts personalized, professional emails to move them to the next stage. It can automatically send an email to schedule the AI Video Interview, provide status updates, or send the AI Rejection Report. The recruiter simply approves the draft, and the AI handles the communication. The LLM acts as a communication specialist and content generator. It uses its reasoning capabilities to draft empathetic and professional messages tailored to the candidate's status and the company's brand, ensuring a seamless and automated candidate experience.
- Predictive Hiring Analytics: The Analytics Dashboard is supercharged with predictive capabilities. The AI analyzes historical data and current candidate metrics to forecast key outcomes. It can predict the average time-to-hire for a specific role, the likelihood of a candidate accepting an offer, or which skills are most likely to lead to a successful hire for a given company. The LLM acts as a data scientist and predictive model. It analyzes patterns within the mockDB (simulating historical data) and uses its reasoning to generate insights and predictions about future hiring outcomes.
- Dynamic Interview Question Generation: The AI Video Interview feature is enhanced with a dynamic question engine. Based on a candidate's resume, their deep review analysis, and the specific role's requirements, the AI generates a unique, customized set of questions on the fly for each candidate. This ensures every interview is personalized and targeted, and it allows ARYA and SAARTHI to have more meaningful interactions. The LLM acts as a dynamic content creator and human resources specialist, crafting questions to probe specific areas of a candidate's profile. This removes the need for recruiters to manually prepare for each interview.
- Skill Gap Identification & Training Suggestions: For rejected candidates or even hired ones, the AI analyzes the gap between their skills and the ideal profile for the role. It provides specific, actionable recommendations for upskilling, including suggestions for online courses, projects, or certifications that would make them a more competitive candidate in the future. The LLM acts as a career coach and curriculum designer. It uses its reasoning to compare a candidate's profile against a benchmark (the ideal role) and generates personalized feedback for self-improvement.
- Automated Onboarding & Post-Hire Success Forecasting: The AI's role extends beyond the hiring decision. Upon a candidate being marked as 'Hired,' the system automatically synthesizes a personalized 30-60-90 day onboarding plan. This plan is generated by the LLM, incorporating the role's responsibilities, the company's inferred culture, and the new hire's individual strengths and learning style (from their resume analysis). Additionally, the AI uses historical data (simulated within our system) to generate a 'Performance Forecast,' predicting the likelihood of the new hire's long-term success and suggesting key areas for early-career support. This feature turns a manual HR task into a proactive, AI-driven process.
- Self-Correcting Candidate Scoring: The 'Continuous AI Rubric Refinement' feature is enhanced with direct feedback. When a recruiter manually overrides an AI decision (e.g., hiring a candidate the AI initially rejected), the system flags this as a learning event. The AI performs a root-cause analysis, comparing its initial scoring and reasoning to the human's decision. It then suggests a refined version of the rubric and its weightings for that specific company or role type. The recruiter is presented with these suggestions and can approve them, making the AI's scoring more accurate and aligned with human intuition over time.
- Dynamic Candidate Re-engagement: No talent is ever truly lost. The AI continuously monitors the pool of rejected candidates and those who were never matched to a role. When a new role is created or an existing role's requirements change, the AI automatically re-evaluates the entire pool of previously screened resumes. If a strong match is found (above a certain confidence threshold), the AI autonomously drafts a personalized email to the candidate, inviting them to re-apply for the new, more suitable position. The recruiter is simply notified that the AI has successfully re-engaged a 'ghost candidate.'
- AI-Powered Global Talent Mapping: The system elevates its capabilities from internal recruitment to a market-facing strategic tool. The AI (SAARTHI) continuously analyzes its own internal hiring data and combines it with simulated external market intelligence to create a 'Global Talent Map.' This map highlights trends in the Indian job market, identifying emerging skill sets, predicting future talent shortages, and comparing the company's hiring performance to market benchmarks. This provides recruiters with an automated, proactive view of the market, empowering them to make strategic hiring decisions well in advance.
- Autonomous Offer Negotiation & Drafting: Once a candidate is marked 'Hired,' the AI takes over the final offer process. It accesses the company's pre-approved salary bands (simulated in this prototype), analyzes the candidate's market value based on their skills and experience (from resume analysis), and cross-references this with external market data (from Global Talent Mapping). It then autonomously drafts a competitive offer letter, including a suggested salary, benefits package, and a compelling narrative about why the candidate is a perfect fit. The recruiter only needs to review and approve the final document.
- AI-Powered "Culture Fit" Synthesis: The biggest challenge for any autonomous system is evaluating soft skills and cultural fit, which are often the primary reason a new hire doesn't work out. This feature would use the AI to generate a 'Cultural Alignment Profile' for each candidate by analyzing their resume's narrative, inferred soft skills, and interview responses. This profile would be a qualitative summary that highlights how the candidate's communication style, problem-solving approach, and work experience align with the company's publicly stated values and inferred culture. This would provide a critical, non-score-based data point to help recruiters make the final human decision with unprecedented insight.
